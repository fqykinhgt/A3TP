# A3TP: Automated, Accurate, and Adaptive UAV Task Planning for Power Transmission Networks Inspection

# Abstract
UAV-assisted inspection is essential for maintaining largescale power transmission networks. While recent work has explored automated trajectory generation, high-quality inspection requires more than safe paths. Expert-level inspection task planning must jointly optimize UAV trajectories and camera configurations, while adapting to diverse tower structures and established inspection standards to ensure comprehensive and reliable visual data. We propose A 3TP, an automated, accurate, and adaptive UAV task planning system tailored for large-scale power transmission network inspection. A 3TP integrates: (1) Expertise-driven task modeling to encode human planning knowledge from historical plans, (2) Geometry-centric planning to generate reference trajectories and shooting parameters for identifying all inspection targets, and (3) Deployment-adaptive trajectory optimization to ensure safety and inspection coverage in complex environments. Operating in a knowledge-driven manner, A 3TP achieves up to 55.78% IoU improvement over supervised baselines, over 96% classification accuracy, and trajectory planning results comparable to human experts. In a real-world deployment covering 373 towers across 65.84 km, A 3TP reduced planning time by 95.3%, achieved an over 88% expert acceptance rate, and reliably detected field defects. These results demonstrate A 3TP’s scalability and practical value for maintaining real-world power transmission networks. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/fqykinhgt/A3TP.git
